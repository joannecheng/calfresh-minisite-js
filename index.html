            <p>
              People of all backgrounds receive food assistance, but the vast
              majority of them were already struggling to
              <a href="#making_ends_meet">make ends meet</a>

              We’ve taken a deep dive into our applicant data, and have gathered
              their stories to provide a more accurate picture of who receives
              food assistance in America.

              At Code for America, we run GetCalFresh.org, which helps 20,000+
              households apply for food assistance every month. We know that
              even people who are experiencing hunger pains have to overcome
              stigma in order to seek out help. Despite the hardships that they
              have recently faced, many of our users still feel compelled to
              describe the reluctance, often shame, they feel in asking for
              help. They might mention how they waited too long to apply, that
              they have never asked for help before, or that they hope to be off
              of food assistance as quickly as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The stigma our users experience arises from inaccurate myths.
              Myths about food assistance have a deep resonance in American
              culture. They only need an occasional sensational anecdote to
              persist. As stories, these myths tend to be more memorable than
              statistics or research findings. This site presents stories in the
              service of helping us to recall the facts. It showcases real,
              representative stories of people seeking and receiving assistance
              alongside pertinent and rigorous research findings.

              The vast majority of our users’ stories are united by two very
              commonplace themes: precariousness and an unexpected expense or
              loss of income.footnote The stories first presented on this site
              describe the precarious financial lives of many Californians. Once
              cost of living is taken into account, California is the state with
              the highest poverty rate.footnote The second set of stories
              describes common shocks or adverse events that lead people to
              apply for food assistance. Coupled with this vulnerability, an
              illness, injury, loss of a job, a rent increase, or even a car
              breakdown might be enough to force a household to begin making
              choices between food and other necessities. By weaving real-life
              stories together with solid research, our hope is to begin to
              replace myths with lived realities in the popular imagination.

              [Expandable box / image] What is SNAP? What is CalFresh? What
              determines eligibility? SNAP is the Supplemental Nutrition
              Assistance Program, which is funded by the federal government and
              administered by the states. To qualify, individuals must make less
              than 130% (200% in CA) of the Federal Poverty Rate Pre-tax AND
              less than 100% of the Poverty Rate after taxes and deductions. For
              a household of 2, that’s a monthly income of $1,784 gross and
              $1,372 net. footnote Any citizen or permanent resident who can
              prove that they qualify can enroll. The program provides a maximum
              of $192 per month for a household of 1 or $642 per month for a
              household of 4. Funds are distributed via Electronic Benefit
              Transfer (EBT) Cards that look and function like a debit card.
              These funds can only be used at approved stores for food items,
              such as bread, cereal, fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, and dairy.
              Recipients cannot purchase alcohol, tobacco, or any non-food items
              with SNAP money.footnote 1, footnote 2 The program was renamed in
              each state due to stigma. In California, it’s known as CalFresh.

I know I would need to submit paychecks when I receive one, but right now I am bringing in $0. They say the first few months are rough. (Placer)

I barely got by. I am almost embarrassed to be here, but hey, it happens, and I know I am not alone. First and foremost, my son needs to know that food will always be available. (Orange)
It still feels strange to have to skip 1-2 meals a day. I don't like to think of myself as the type of person that complains about their situation either. I will always do anything in my power to overcome adverse situations. By applying for CalFresh, I don't see myself as complacent, but attempting to take control of my situation and the cards life has dealt me. (Orange)

              These economic circumstances mean that many people have no buffer
              if they suddenly incur a large expense or lose income. It is not
              surprising that the most common dilemma GetCalFresh applicants
              mention in their applications is not being able to afford food
              after paying for rent, utilities, and gas or fare to get to work.
              In their applications for food assistance, about three in five of
              our applicants report having less than $100 on hand.

              In some counties, rising income inequality means that a large
              share of people won’t be able to keep up with the high cost of
              basic necessities.

              Many of these working families have an additional challenge, such

              I am going to buy food, pay my utilities or put gas in my car, let

              have a child with autism and he only goes to a educational program
              for 3 hours a day.” In Humboldt county the cost of living for a
              single parent with one child is $3,000 more than the median
              income.

              This data tells a story of stress: the typical household in
              several counties is already struggling to make ends meet. These
              households have no slack in their incomes - they already cannot
              keep up with the bare necessities. A single car accident, medical
              emergency, or unexpected layoff can put a family over their budget
              for months, often forcing a choice between something as essential
              as food, housing, or medical care.

              Put simply, Californians live in circumstances that make it very
              likely many people will need to apply for food assistance to make
              it through unexpected challenges. In fact, the most common
              sentiment expressed in our applications is the difficulty of
              making ends, particularly after an experiencing an adverse event.
              The next two sections explore two of the most common types of
              shocks: a job loss or reduction in hours and illness or
              disability.

              A common shock that leads people who are already struggling to
              make ends meet to apply for food assistance is a job loss or a
              reduction in hours. Our applicants who have recently had hours cut
              or lost a job are looking for a better job. When it comes time to
              renew food assistance after six months, the most common reason
              applicants tell us for no longer needing food assistance is that
              they got a job or a better job.

I am at an age of neither a senior citizen nor a person with a career and in her
40's but, rather in my late 50's. My story is this: I had a great job, went out
on a surgery to fix an injury that occured from work. Upon being out, they laid
me off after 14 years of service. I then took from my 401K to continue my house
payments, only to drain my retirement and still end up losing my home to the
loan sharks and banks who preyed upon people such as myself. Upon losing my job,
my home, and my retirement, I was left with nothing but a vehicle and I turned
to the street. I am grateful to the folks at CalFresh, I can literally say I was
starving and have never experienced that before, not only did it open my eyes to
the homeless and less fortunate, but I actually used a service that was there
for people in my situation and that I am grateful for. I am thankful that you
people saw it as an emergency to get me my card. Wow - the system worked in my
favor for a change! Although I'm saddened by having learned that the less
fortunate are invisible to so many people. I've now been on the other side of
the fence, and I am still in shock how badly people treat others who don't have
anything, like we are not there. My heart pours out to those who truly want a
better life but just can't pull themselves out of the whirlpool. Bitter and
grateful at same time. Thank you for the help - a full stomach or warm coffee
made the world a better place to look at.
