            <p>
              People of all backgrounds receive food assistance, but the vast
              majority of them were already struggling to
              <a href="#making_ends_meet">make ends meet</a>
              when they were hit with an a

              We’ve taken a deep dive into our applicant data, and have gathered
              their stories to provide a more accurate picture of who receives
              food assistance in America.

              The stigma placed on recipients of food assistance is fueled by
              cultural myths so deeply rooted that they only require an
              occasional anecdote to maintain their force. Though unsupported by
              the facts, this stigma matters because it deters people from
              seeking the assistance that would help them get back on their
              feet. More research has not seemed to help - for decades, study
              after study has disproved these myths. In recent years, not only
              have the raw data to examine these myths been available online,
              but non-partisan policy groups have repeatedly released clear,
              rigorous rebuttals of these myths. Yet, stories that capture the
              imagination tend to have more staying power than statistics.
              Without the scaffolding of a story, statistics are easy to forget.
              The purpose of this site is to elevate the stories of real people
              who apply for and benefit from food assistance. Our users’ stories
              both echo the research and, we hope, will make it memorable.

              In running <a target="_blank" href="https://getcalfresh.org">GetCalFresh.org</a>,
              which helps 20,000+ households who apply for food assistance every
              month, we know that even people who are experiencing hunger pains
              have to overcome stigma in order to seek out help. On our site,
              users can explain why they are applying for food assistance to
              their county. Despite the hardships that they have recently faced,
              many of our users are still compelled to describe the reluctance,
              often shame, they feel in asking for help. They might mention how
              they waited too long to apply, that they have never asked for help
              before, or that they hope to be off of food assistance as quickly
              as possible. Not only do their stories reveal the harm caused by
              stigma, their descriptions of their lives put the lie to popular
              stereotypes. None wanted to apply for food assistance. All are
              striving to improve their situation. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Stories, not statistics, can make people relatable. We can
              recognize challenges we’ve faced or that friends or family have
              faced in stories. In fact, the vast majority of our users’ stories
              are united by two very commonplace themes: precariousness and an
              unexpected expense or loss of income. Precariousness is well-known
              to Californians, given that once cost of living is taken into
              account, it is the state with the highest poverty rate. Among our
              users, common adverse life events are often accompanied by a steep
              expense or loss of income. Illness, injury, the loss of a job, a
              car breakdown, or a rent increase might be enough to force a
              household to begin making choices between food and other
              necessities. 
            </p>

            <p>
              In their stories, our users both grapple with the stigma around
              food assistance and disprove the myths that underlie it. In order
              to situate research findings about food assistance in the context
              of everyday life, we obtained permission from hundreds of users to
              share their stories. We hope to show just how relatable their
              struggles are and how food assistance helps them get back on their
              feet.

              People who have never been on food assistance often think that they
              are for people who are somehow different from them. In fact, food
              assistance are a way of coping with a challenge that almost everyone
              is familiar with: making ends meet. And, despite its size and
              economic diversity, California is the fourth most expensive place to
              live in the country, after Hawaii, Washington DC, and New York
              <sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup>. Food assistance eligibility is based
              on the federal poverty line, which is the same across the county.
              Yet, once cost of living is taken into account, as is done in the
              <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-258.pdf">Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure

              These economic circumstances mean that many people have no buffer
              if they suddenly incur a large expense or lose income. It is not
              surprising that the most common dilemma GetCalFresh applicants
              mention in their applications is not being able to afford food
              after paying for rent, utilities, and gas or fare to get to work.
              In their applications for food assistance, about three in five of
              our applicants report having less than $100 on hand.
            </p>

            <p>
              In some counties, rising income inequality means that a large
              share of people won’t be able to keep up with the high cost of
              basic necessities.

              Many of these working families have an additional challenge, such
              as a child with special needs or variable income. A single mother
              of two children with a negative bank balance in Humboldt county
              wrote, “All of my credit cards are maxed out and I do not know how
              I am going to buy food, pay my utilities or put gas in my car, let
              alone pay the rest of my bills this month. I am job hunting, but I
              have a child with autism and he only goes to a educational program
              for 3 hours a day.” In Humboldt county the cost of living for a
              single parent with one child is $3,000 more than the median
              income.

              This data tells a story of stress: the typical household in
              several counties is already struggling to make ends meet. These
              households have no slack in their incomes - they already cannot
              keep up with the bare necessities. A single car accident, medical
              emergency, or unexpected layoff can put a family over their budget
              for months, often forcing a choice between something as essential
              as food, housing, or medical care.

              Put simply, Californians live in circumstances that make it very
              likely many people will need to apply for food assistance to make
              it through unexpected challenges. In fact, the most common
              sentiment expressed in our applications is the difficulty of
              making ends, particularly after an experiencing an adverse event.
              The next two sections explore two of the most common types of
              shocks: a job loss or reduction in hours and illness or
              disability.

              A common shock that leads people who are already struggling to
              make ends meet to apply for food assistance is a job loss or a
              reduction in hours. Our applicants who have recently had hours cut
              or lost a job are looking for a better job. When it comes time to
              renew food assistance after six months, the most common reason
              applicants tell us for no longer needing food assistance is that
              they got a job or a better job.

I am at an age of neither a senior citizen nor a person with a career and in her
40's but, rather in my late 50's. My story is this: I had a great job, went out
on a surgery to fix an injury that occured from work. Upon being out, they laid
me off after 14 years of service. I then took from my 401K to continue my house
payments, only to drain my retirement and still end up losing my home to the
loan sharks and banks who preyed upon people such as myself. Upon losing my job,
my home, and my retirement, I was left with nothing but a vehicle and I turned
to the street. I am grateful to the folks at CalFresh, I can literally say I was
starving and have never experienced that before, not only did it open my eyes to
the homeless and less fortunate, but I actually used a service that was there
for people in my situation and that I am grateful for. I am thankful that you
people saw it as an emergency to get me my card. Wow - the system worked in my
favor for a change! Although I'm saddened by having learned that the less
fortunate are invisible to so many people. I've now been on the other side of
the fence, and I am still in shock how badly people treat others who don't have
anything, like we are not there. My heart pours out to those who truly want a
better life but just can't pull themselves out of the whirlpool. Bitter and
grateful at same time. Thank you for the help - a full stomach or warm coffee
made the world a better place to look at.
