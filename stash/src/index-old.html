        This is a section where we would talk about how hard it is to make ends
        meet in California.
        </p>

        <p>
        Even when a household in California is making enough money to stay out
        of poverty, it's very easy to end up without enough money at the end of
        the month. Rent, health care, transportation costs, and other costs add
        up quickly, making it hard to have enough money for food.

        There will be a visualization here that shows typical costs for a household

        make less than 50K a year).
